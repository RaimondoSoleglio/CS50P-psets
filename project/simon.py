    # have an intro? maybe with music?
    
    # when you press start the game begins
    
    # create an interface with four colours to mimic Simon game
    
    # game mechanics:
    # 1 - the computer randomly picks a colour (associated with sound) and plays it brightening the colour
    # 2 - the player needs to repeat the same (time countdown?)
    # 3 - the computer stores the first colour and rnd picks a second, showing them in a sequence
    # 4 - player again
    # 5 - every time player is right score increases
    # 6 - if player is wrong (or time is over) game ends
    # 7 - optional: does the sequence go faster and faster after a bit?
